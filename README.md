# ETL Pipeline for Bank Marketing Campaign Data | End-to-End-Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fully functional ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms (including sanitization of data using the Pandas library), loads, and analyzes data. The pipeline leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Cloud Storage and BigQuery.

## Objective
Tasked with cleaning and reformatting marketing campaign data on personal loans to meet specified structure and data types for BigQuery, enabling storage and seamless integration of future campaigns. The bank has supplied a CSV file, "bank_marketing.csv," which needs to be processed, sanitized using the Pandas library, and split into three final CSV files for further analysis.
